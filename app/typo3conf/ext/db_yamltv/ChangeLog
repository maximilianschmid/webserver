************************************************************************************************************************
12.05.2008 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Public release V 3.0.4 beta
- Changed default values of pages because the pages were rewritten to get consecutive UIDs
  affected constants:
  searchPagePID changed to 5
  headerNavigationIncludeList changed to 6,5,4
  homePageUID changed to 23 from 2
  mainMenuJsMenuPage changed to TSFE:id=23 from TSFE:id=2
- removed the following extensions from the list of suggested extensions:
  pmktextarea (TYPO3 4.2 has now its own TS editor as system extension)
  newloginbox (TYPO3 4.2 has a new login box as a system extension)
  t3skin_improved (not sure if it runs properly with TYPO3 4.2)
  ter_update_check (now part of TYPO3 4.2 itself)
- set userIndexingOn to 0 as default. Indexing should always be turned on only, if a site is completely finished.
- added userIndexMetaTagsOn to constant editor and set to 0, because this feature became possible now.
  In most cases it is NOT usesful to index meta-tags, because if a search word is contained in meta tags
  and a user enters that word, ALL pages in the pagetree are returned as result.
  Indexing meta tags is only useful if no global meta tags are used.
- added width and height to first and second header image, for accessibility reasons.
- switched off Dublin-Core-Elements for metatags by default.
- added the feature to use a transparent background for both image-replacement and images in the header.
  Thanks to "dr-tech" for the suggestion and the code he provided in our forum.
- Changed the languageLocale-Settings from an option-box to string to make it possible to enter just anything in constant editor.
  This was a user suggestion in the forum.
- Removed the fontsize selector script by default. Can be activated in constant editor.
  set fontSizeSelectorOff = 1
  This now removes all relevant JavaScript as well and adds it again, when turned on.
- Removed selector box for last updated pages by default. Can be activatet in constant editor.
  set selectorBoxOff = 1
- Added CSS-Code for the standard TYPO3-sitmap to content.css, in case anyone does not want to use dropdown_sitemap.
- Added CSS-Code for the new index_search of TYPO3 4.2, which is now DIV-based instead of TABLE-based.
- The whole TypoScript code is now in external files:
  fileadmin/styles/[style]/TemplateRessources/constants.txt
  fileadmin/styles/[style]/TemplateRessources/setup.txt
  fileadmin/styles/[style]/TemplateRessources/pageTSconfig.txt
  fileadmin/styles/[style]/TemplateRessources/userTSconfig.txt
  So there is only one line in constants, setup and pageTSconfig:
  <INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="FILE: fileadmin/styles/[style]/TemplateRessources/constants.txt">
  <INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="FILE: fileadmin/styles/[style]/TemplateRessources/setup.txt">
  <INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="FILE: fileadmin/styles/[style]/TemplateRessources/pageTSconfig.txt">
  Either these files can be edited or TypoScript code can be added in the normal way.
  <INCLUDE_TYPOSCRIPT: source="FILE: fileadmin/styles/[style]/TemplateRessources/userTSconfig.txt
  must be set manually, because I don't have access to the users that have been or will be created.
- Changed the state to beta again, because of the extensive changes which have been applied.
************************************************************************************************************************
29.04.2008 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Internal release V 3.0.1 beta
- Discovered and solved a problem which occurs, when using differnt styles on the same site,
  the maginfying glasses (efaFontSize) *and* different font-sizes for each style.
  The cookie had always the same name and therefore the fontsize was not saved correctly when
  switching between styles with different basis fontsizes.
  From now on, each style has its own fontsize script(s), using different cookie names.
  The cookie name can be set in line 113 of fileadmin/styles/[pageLayout]/scripts/efa_fontsize.js
- Commented out
  $TCA['pages']['types']['4']['showitem'] = 'hidden;;;;1-1-1, doktype, title;;3;;2-2-2, subtitle, nav_hide, media;;;;4-4-4, shortcut;;;;3-3-3, shortcut_mode, TSconfig;;6;nowrap;5-5-5, storage_pid;;7, l18n_cfg, tx_templavoila_ds;;;;1-1-1, tx_templavoila_to, tx_templavoila_next_ds, tx_templavoila_next_to, tx_templavoila_flex;;;;1-1-1';
  in typo3conf/ext/db_yamltv/ext_tables.php
  This line made it possible, to upload images in a page of type shortcut.
  TYPO3 4.2 now does this out of the box.
  Unfortunately I cannot just leave the line in place, because then
  the nice feature that page properties are beeing displayed in tabs (TYPO3 4.2 feature), is LOST.
  !! Please uncomment the line if you are using TYPO3 4.1.x !!
- Changed the field names in TemplaVoila datastructure to make it possible,
  to change design, without th need to re-arrange the content.
  field_maincontent (INNER) is mapped to a DIV containing the main content (always used)
  field_sidecontent (INNER) is mapped to a DIV containg the side content (only used in 3-column page layouts)
  field_menucontent (INNER) is mapped to a DIV to show content below the menu.
  PLEASE UPDATE YOUR MAPPING, if you really want to update an existing website (not recommended).
  I recommend to use this versions for new projects ONLY. Although it is possible to update
  existing projects, it is not necessary.
  field_header (INNER), field_nav (INNER), field_teaser (OUTER), field_submenu (OUTER), field_selectorbox (OUTER) and field_footer (OUTER)
  were left unchanged.
************************************************************************************************************************
02.04.2008 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Internal release V 3.0.0 beta
- Changed the path to all styles from
  fileadmin/css/
  to
  fileadmin/styles/
  This gives us a path like
  fileadmin/styles/01_layouts_basics/css/screen/
  which is somewhat more logical than
  fileadmin/css/01_layouts_basics/css/screen/
- Added a compatibility-mode to make it possible to use this version with older styles.
  Just add
  yamlCompatMode1 = 1
  to the TS constants on a page where old style are beeing used.
************************************************************************************************************************
15.02.2008 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Public release V 2.1.0 stable
- fixed typos in setup, wrong spelling of constants
  secondThirdLanguage -> thirdForeignLanguage
  secondFourthLanguage -> fourthForeignLanguage
  secondFifthLanguage -> fifthForeignLanguage
  secondSixthLanguage -> sixthForeignLanguage
- Deleted all DSs and TOs, left only
  YAML standard 3col_standard (DS) and
  YAML standard 3col_standard [TEMPLATE] (TO)
  all the other were made t3d files, that can be imported if needed:
  - 02_layouts_2col.t3d / *.zip
  - 03_layouts_3col.t3d / *.zip
  - 04_layouts_styling.t3d / *.zip
  - 05_layouts_advanced.t3d / *.zip
  all are present in fileadmin/_yaml-styles from now on.
  Other will be added to THAT directory only.
************************************************************************************************************************
11.02.2008 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Public release V 2.0.13 stable
- Deleted the old brown standard layout and switched to a more modern and simple one:
  3col_standard.html ist the standard now.
  Please remember that this is no ready-to-use template, the design has always to be adapted.
  Deleted the template objects of the old layout but left the Datastructures in place.
- The complete CSS code was reviewed and simplified.
- Added rgtabs to the list of recommended extensions and made an example configuration.
- Changed the CSS code of rgtabs that is uses sliding doors navigation and the tabs are flexible in height.
- Minor changes to forgotten comments and translations.
- Added descriptions to all template objects.
- Changed <langDisable>0</langDisable> to <langDisable>1</langDisable> as recommended by
  TemplaVoila.
  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT LANGUAGES ARE DISABLED NOW. Pleave do not change this setting.
- Installed sys_action, so that its functionality is present in the complete package.

************************************************************************************************************************
16.9.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Public release V 2.0.11 stable
- Fixed Bug #0000019 where a filename was not found with Unix OS, but was found with windows.
  http://bugs.t3net.de/view.php?id=19
- Added <span class="hideme">.</span> at the end to constants
    headerSkiplinkHtmlCodeStandardLang, headerSkiplinkHtmlCodeFirstLang and headerSkiplinkHtmlCodeSecondLang
    as it is in YAML standard layouts.
- Added most of the YAML standard templates as DS and TOs
- Added {$yamlDebugOn} to YAML-EXPERT-SETTINGS as a switch to use YAML debugging features,
  import the stylesheet for that and show a grid as background-image of body tag.
- Added the feature that a link is shown at each columns end, which makes it
  possible to extend the column by inserting dummy-text. For testing purposes.
  Added {$yamlFillerLinkOn} to YAML-EXPERT-SETTINGS.
- Changed TCA of pagetype 4 (shortcut) to make it possible to save images on this type of page,
  without the need to switch to type 2 (extended) and back, to add images.
- Changed numbering of temp.buildHeaderData and now count from 20 to 31 to make it clear,
  that this belongs together and nothing must be between it. If you have to include
  own header data, please start counting from 50 - 900 or if your data must appear before the
  YAML stylesheets use 1 to 19 - notice, that 20 to 49 is reserved for future use.
************************************************************************************************************************
9.9.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Public release V 2.0.10 stable
- Fixed Bug #0000017 where the TS-Language menu caused problems.
  http://bugs.t3net.de/view.php?id=17

  Added a sample-configuration file to
  	fileadmin/cooluri/CoolURIConf.xml
- Added more categories in constant-editor to make it more clearly laid out:

    YAML-LANGUAGE* (15); YAML-HEADLINES (30); YAML-STATISTICS (4); YAML-URLS (8);
    YAML-EXPERT-SETTINGS (6).
    Note: Some options were moved to other categroies. This doesn't change functionality.
************************************************************************************************************************
2.9.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Public release V 2.0.9 stable
- Unfortunately there ARE people, causing nothing but trouble...
    So, due to legal matters (wich I deny, btw.) the code that reads two fields in
    TemplaVoila XML-structure, in order to find out the name of the YAML-stylesheets,
    was re-written and put under the Creative Commons Licence (CC), instead of GPL.
    Functionality is exactly the same.
    Thanks anyway, Mr. A. S. from Z in S, for spoiling my weekend, and please
    don't forget (for upcoming events), that many, many people use this template for learning TYPO3
    and DO NOT pay a single cent for it, which ist totally ok to me.
    Where are YOUR contributions to the TYPO3 community?
  So version 2.0.9 has the SAME funcionality than 2.0.8, without adding or changing features.
************************************************************************************************************************
1.9.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Internal release V 2.0.8 stable
- Fixed Bug #0000014 where the Boxes with round corners where
  not displayed correctly in IE 6 and IE 7
  http://bugs.t3net.de/view.php?id=14
- Fixed Bug #0000015 where encrypted email-links could not be decrypted again,
  because the JavaScript funtion was missing.
  http://bugs.t3net.de/view.php?id=15
  Changed static setup to:
    config.removeDefaultJS = external
- Implemented a new language menu, which is fully configurable whith TypeScript,
  where the old one was using an external PHP-script, the user had to edit.
    renamed script to fileadmin/scripts/languageMenu.php.notUsed
    and left in place for compatibilty.
    Replaced TypoScript Code in lib.teaser.20
- Added constants
  langMenuActAltTitleTags, langMenuActFileNames, langMenuActBackColor, langMenuDimmedAltTitleTags, langMenuDimmedFileNames, langMenuDimmedBackColor
    to Constant editor to make the language menu user-configurable.
- Added three HTML templates
    2col_left_0-u.html, 2col_left_0-ul.html, 2col_left_132.html
  containing ONLY DIV-structures and nothing else.
- Added two datastructures:
  "One column without menu" and "Three columns with menu"
  - Added three template objects:
    "1 column with upper and lower content", "1 column with upper content" and "3 cols without subtemplate"
  to make it possible to comprehend all examples provided with YAML distribution.
- Fixed a bug where HTML output did not validate when tab-navigation was turned off.
  The skiplink anchor was then the first thing after <ul> tags, which is not allowed.
    changed lib.submenu to lib.submenu.10 and put the skiplink anchor
    in lib.submenu.1.10 IF tab navigation is off, to make sure it is outside of <ul> Tags.
- Added
    plugin.tx_cssstyledcontent._CSS_DEFAULT_STYLE >
  to local TS setup. This deletes all default styles. They were copied to content.css instead.
  This makes it easier to edit the styles instead of having them in an extra stylesheet that
  TYPO3 would create, if they were NOT deleted. The problem here is, that TYPO3 adds this
  auto-generated stylesheet as the LAST one. So changes made by the user in content.css
  would be OVERWRITTEN again by the auto-generated style-sheet. Hard to understand for a Newbie...
  The disadvantage of this is, that that certain constants are used by cssstyledcontent to create
  some CSS-selctors and CSS-attributes, which can be defined in constant editor. This DOES NOT
  work anymore now. If this is a problem for you, just DELETE the styles from content.css again
  and DELETE or comment out
    plugin.tx_cssstyledcontent._CSS_DEFAULT_STYLE >
    in local TS setup.
- Provided a t3d file to update older versions.
- Finished all example pages and provided starter-package-extended-2_0_7.t3d,
  containing the whole pagetree with all examples, datastructures and template objects.
- Provided a complete package containing TYPO3 4.12 with this version 2.0.8 and the whole pagetree.
- Added {$subMenuExpandToggle} to static constants, to give user the possibilty,
  to set wheter or not he wants all levels of submenu expanded.
************************************************************************************************************************
29.8.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Public release V 2.0.7 stable
- Bug #0000013: Fixed a typo in constants, where {$headerBannerWidth} is explained as Height and vice-versa.
- Removed
    * {font-family:'Trebuchet MS', Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;}
  from fileadmin/css/screen/typo3-RTE.css
  Added
    RTE.default.ignoreMainStyleOverride = 0
    RTE.default.mainStyleOverride = body.htmlarea-content-body {font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;}
  to local pageTSconfig instead.
  This gives the user the option to decide, what font is used within the RTE,
  without affecting the frontend in any way.
- Removed RTE.fonts {*}
  from local pageTSconfig.
- Removed RTE.default.fontFace = face1, face2, face3, face4
  from local pageTSconfig, because font-formatting should be done using CSS only.
- Changed RTE.colors to red, green and blue to leave just an example and
  let the user decide which ones to use and add more if he likes to.
- Edited some of the explanations of constants in constant editor, to make them a little bit more understandable.
- Added an alternative design to make it totally clear to everbody, that neither
  the HTML templates nor the TypoScript code have anything to do with the DESIGN of the web.
  Three files need to be copied to fileadmin/css/*, renamed to *.css and the originals replaced with:
    fileadmin/alternativeDesign/css/layout_2col_left_13.css.AlternativeDesign
    fileadmin/alternativeDesign/css/screen/basemod.css.AltnernativeDesign
    fileadmin/alternativeDesign/css/screen/content.css.AlternativeDesign
  It IS that easy with YAML, REALLY ...
- Added the fonts nimbus.ttf and vera.ttf to fileadmin/fonts/
- Made lib.teaser.40 a COA_INT in order to NOT cache date and time.
- Added the constant {$userDisablePrefComm} and put it in YAML-EXPERT-SETTINGS,
  to give user the chance to debug the TypoScript code.
- Added stdWrap.prefixComment = 2|(...) everywhere it's useful, for easier debugging.
- Made lib.footer a COA, so the user can add own objects here.
- Made lib.selectorBox a COA, so the user can add own objects here.
- Added CSS-Code as an example for mailform.

  If the customer is insistent that original CI-fonts are used for headlines, this feature makes it possible.
  Search-Engines see regular text, graphical browsers display the (background)-image.

24.8.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Public release V 2.0.5 stable
- Added a CSS-class to both header images (user suggestion).
- Wrapped lib.selectorBox in condition [globalVar = TSFE:id = {$mainMenuJsMenuPage}],
  to show it only on 1 page, as it was with old versions. Hmmm, anbody needs it on ALL pages??
  Put the code in local setup then, please.
- Added constant {$mainMenuJsMenuPage} to give user the choice with page that selector box is on.
- Added an option to make it so that the first image in header can be a link to the homepage (user suggestion).
- Added constant {$linkFirstImageToggle}
- Added constant {$homePageUID}
- Released it - puh, thanks god! i'tired now.
************************************************************************************************************************
23.8.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Internal release V 2.0.4 beta
- Fixed a severe bug where the css/ folder was part of this extension instead
  of residing in fileadmin/ - This bug, in case of an update of this extension,
  would have overwritten all changes the user has already applied to his CSS files.
  Version should have never been out in public. Sorry for the mess.
- Documentation file is now in place, even if it is empty. :(
  I definitly WILL write documentation, i promise.
- Added the option to turn off #submenu completely.
  - Added the constant {$subMenuOff}
  - Added:
    [globalVar = LIT:1 = {$subMenuOff}]
    lib.submenu =
    [global]
    to lib.submenu
- Added CSS-Code to format the output of the content element "simple table" a little nicer.
  - Added:
    /* Content element "table" */
    table.contenttable {font-size:0.8em; width:100%; margin:0 0 1em 0; border-collapse:collapse; empty-cells:show;}
    table.contenttable caption {text-align:left; font-weight:bold; color:#888; margin-bottom:0.2em;}
    table.contenttable th {height:2.0em; background:#4E5155; color:white; padding:2px 7px 2px 7px; border-left:solid 2px #fff; border-right:solid 2px #fff; border-top:solid 2px #fff; border-bottom:solid 2px #ffff;}
    table.contenttable tr.tr-odd {background: #eee;}
    table.contenttable tr.tr-even {background: #e3e3e3;}
    table.contenttable td {height:3.0em; padding:2px 7px 2px 7px; border-left:solid 2px #fff; border-right:solid 2px #fff; border-top:solid 2px #fff; border-bottom:solid 2px #ffff; text-align:left; font-weight:normal}
    to content.css (not part of extension, but part of starter-packages)
- Added one more FCE with two templates (two and three columns) where user is able
  to define its width and height (in pixels) within the FCE (thanks to Holger for the code).
- Added CSS-Code to format the previously added FCE.
  - Added:
    /* ################################
    ** ### FCE adjustable columns     #
    ** ################################
    */
    div.flexi {overflow:hidden; display:block; clear:both; width:100%; height:1%;}
    div.flexi div {display:block; overflow:hidden; float:left;}
    div.flexi div.left {margin-right:5px;}
    div.flexi div.center {margin-right:5px; margin-left:5px;}
    div.flexi div.right {margin-left:5px;}
    /* FCE adjustable columns End */
    to content.css (not part of extension, but part of starter-packages)
- Constant {$rootlineLinkWrap} was of type wrap. That made it impossible to enter an option-split in constant editor.
  - Changend type to string.
- Added {$docTypeToUse} to make it possible to choose the desired doctype in constant editor.
- Added the option to turn off #footer completely.
  - Added the constant {$footerOff}
  - Changed mapping-mode from inner to outer in all TOs, because it makes
    no sense that the container is still in place, if the user wishes to get
    rid of #footer.
    - Added:
      lib.footer.wrap = <div id="footer">|</div>
      to lib.footer
    - Added:
      [globalVar = LIT:1 = {$footerOff}]
      lib.footer =
      [global]
      to lib.footer
- Added a routine to put the skiplink anchor #navigation into lib.submenu instead of lib.nav,
  if the user has decided to turn off the entire tab-navigation. If BOTH are turned off, there
  will be NO skiplink anchor at all, but I can't think of any situation, where BOTH menus
  are to be turned off...
- Changed state to "stable" because everything works perfectly.
- Feature-freezed it until it is clear, that there are no hidden bugs anymore.
- Release two t3d files in one package:
  - Minimal starter package:
    with the pages "Rootpage" "General Storage" "News Storage" and "Home".
    This is for experienced users who wants to start a new website.
  - Starter package:
    Contains "Minimal starter package" and a couple of example-pages.
    This is for medium experienced users who wants to start a new website.
    Example pages make it easier to understand the concept. News-examples are already in place.
************************************************************************************************************************
23.8.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Internal Release V 2.0.3 beta
- Fixed a bug that positioned the searchbox incorrectly, when the
  tab-navigation was turned off. Now it is positioned bottom=5px.
  It is now always 5 Pixels away from the end of #header. That,
  as a bonus, leaves space when the tab-navigation becomes wider.
  - Changed basemod.css:
    #header div.tx-macinasearchbox-pi1 {position:absolute; bottom:0px; right:10px; font-size:0.8em;}
- Fixed a bug that positioned #topnav incorrectly, after fixing the
  previous bug.
  - Changed basemod.css:
    #topnav {top:95px;}
- Removed the headline of the searchbox in all languages, because
  there was no space left for it, after fixing the previous two bugs.
  Nobody really needs a headline IMHO, because everybody knows, that this
  is a searchbox, even without a headline.
- Added the option to turn off #teaser completely.
  - Added the constant {$teaserOff}
  - Changed mapping-mode from inner to outer in all TOs, because it makes
    no sense that the container is still in place, if the user wishes to get
    rid of #teaser.
    - Added:
      wrap = <div id="teaser" class="clearfix">|</div>
      to lib.teaser
    - Added:
      [globalVar = LIT:1 = {$teaserOff}]
      lib.teaser =
      [global]
      to lib.teaser
- Changed shortcut-mode of "Rootpage" to "First Subpage" This eleminates
  the problem that it points to a non-existing page, if the user deletes
  "Home" for some reason and creates a new one.
- Corrected typos in serveral stylesheets (comments only).
- Corrected the YAML version printed in comments of own stylesheets.
- Added the stylesheet "fileadmin/myOwnStyles.css" as the last one beeing imported,
  so just anything can be overwritten here without messing up the "real" YAML-Files.
  This was a user-suggestion.
  - Added:
    100 = TEXT
    100.value = <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="fileadmin/css/myOwnStyles.css" />
    to temp.buildHeaderData
- Renamed the 4 "oldStyleColumns" to TV-SP-0, TV-SP-1, TV-SP-3 and TV-SP-4
  to avoid naming annoyances in page-module with "LEFT" "BORDER" etc.
  - Changes made in ext_tables.php
- Added 4 more "oldStyleColumns": TV-SP-4, TV-SP-5, TV-SP-6 and TV-SP-7
  to avoid errors in page-module showing "Value not allowed" when columns are not present.
  - Changes made in ext_tables.php

22.8.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Public release V 2.0.2 beta
- A feature was added to turn on and off template-container, using
  the constant-editor.
- All strings are now available in german, english and french.
  Thanks to Andreas Becker for the help with french language.
- Now two (instead of one) images can be used in header. The container
  #banner can also be used to render banner in that container, using
  a banner-extension e.g. macina_banners.
- Accessible menu was integrated again.
  See http://yaml.t3net.de/Barrierefreie-Menues.36.0.html
  for details.
- New graphics for the flags of the language-menu have been installed.

21.8.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Internal release V 2.0.1 beta
-	Changed the template to make it possible to save the header-image
	directly in a page of type "Advanced". The standard image is saved
	in "Rootpage". Make it an "Advanced" page temporarily, change the
	image, then switch back to "Shortcut".
- The page "Home" is now translated to english language. This is just
  to see if everything works right.
  No other translations will be added.
- Dependencies to other extensions were added. This means that this
  extension can now be installed as the first extension on a fresh
  TYPO3 installation. It will prompt you to install all dependencies
  automatically.
- YAML version 3.0.3 was added.
************************************************************************************************************************
19.8.2007 Dieter Bunkerd  <db@t3net.de>
* Internal release V 2.0.0 beta
	Although we have version 2.0.0 it is still beta.
	This because we already had a template, which was NOT an extension.
	So every version >= 2.0.0 is a TYPO3-Extension.
